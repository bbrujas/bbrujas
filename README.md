- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m **bbrujas**.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in *opensource* and *information sharing*, while I enjoy helping to level the steep *technology learning curve* for new users and discovering new things about *user privacy preservation* techniques.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to expand my learnings around code development, with special interest in NodeJS, Solidity and some web3 capacities. Sometimes I also play with containerised solutions.
- ðŸ“« You'll find me here at github as **@bbrujas**, on twitter as **@bbrujas1** and at Discord as **bbrujas** (formerly bbrujas#6863).

I try to be [RFC-1855](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1855) compliant, if you feel me. :)

Stay funk!
