To connect to a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) provider using web3, you can follow these steps:

1. Install and import web3: ``` npm install web3 ``` ``` const Web3 = require('web3'); ```

2. Create an instance of the Web3 object: ``` const web3 = new Web3('https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org'); ```
Note: Replace the URL with the BSC provider endpoint you want to connect to.

3. Test the connection by getting the current block number: ``` web3.eth.getBlockNumber().then(console.log); ```
This should output the current block number of the connected BSC provider.

Now that you have successfully connected to the BSC provider using web3, you can use its functions to interact with the blockchain, such as sending transactions, querying balances, and interacting with smart contracts.
